I know how you took your coffee
And I know you never drank tea
I know you liked to read the sports page
In front of the TV
And I know you loved me

I know that you worked harder than anyone I'd seen
Show up on time, finish the job
Nothin' in this life comes free
And I know you loved me

I wish you could have seen what I saw
The strong, the brave and the kind
I wish I knew what I know now
Oh I wish I could have seen the signs

I'd know that smile anywhere
You charmed everyone you met
But I know underneath that smile
Was something more complex
And I know you loved me

You built some walls I could never break through
Even though I tried
You held your past so close
Underneath those layers of pride
And I know you loved me

I wish you could have seen what I saw
The strong, the brave and the kind
I wish I knew what I know now
Oh I wish I could have saved your life

I know how you took your coffee
And I know you never drank tea
I know you liked to read the sports page
In front of the TV
And I know you loved me
And I know you loved me
